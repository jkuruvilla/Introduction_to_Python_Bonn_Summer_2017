    "Cryptography is the study of how to make messages secret or how to read secret messages. A very simple encryption technique is called the *Caesar cipher*, which you can read up more about [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The basic idea is that each letter is replaced by a letter that is a certain number of letters away, so for example if the shift was 2, then A would become C, B would become D, etc. (and Z will become B).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program ``cesar.py`` that given a string and a shift, will produce the encrypted string for that shift. Note that the same program can be used to decrypt a message, by passing it a negative shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are: you should only accept and return lowercase letters, and spaces should not be changed. You can assume that the input string obeys these rules and you do not need the input.\n",

    "    \n",
    "**Hints: (1) Find below a construct that allows you to acess all letters of a string one after the other; (2) To solve the task you need to convert letters to numbers and vice versa. There are several ways to do this. One is to use the built-in functions ``chr`` and ``ord`` (and remember you can find out more about a function by using ``?``).**"
