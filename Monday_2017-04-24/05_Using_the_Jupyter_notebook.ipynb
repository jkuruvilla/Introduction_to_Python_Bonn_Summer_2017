    "The Jupyter *notebook* is a relatively new feature that has been implemented with Python, and allows you to write notebooks similar to e.g. Mathematica. It runs within your Web-Browser. The advantage of doing this is that you can include text, code, and plots in the same document. This makes it ideal for example to write up a report about a project that uses mostly Python code, in order to share with others. In fact, the notes for this course are written using the IPython notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Juypter notebooks are the successor of IPython-notebooks. The latter only could be used with Python. In contrast Jupyter notebooks (Jupyter is a short-cut for *Julia - Python - R*) can be used with a large variety of programming languages at the same time, e.g. the statistical *R*-language. See [this page](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) for a complete list of languages that can be integrated into Jupyter notebooks."
