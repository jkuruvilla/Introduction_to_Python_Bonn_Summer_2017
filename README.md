# Introduction_to_Python_Bonn_Summer_2017
Materials for the course 'Introduction to Scientific Programming' (AIfA; Summer Term 2017)

## Goal of the course
The goal of the course is to teach physics-students on the master and
PhD level how to efficiently and flexibly solve scientific programming
problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming language
Python. The course specifically addresses students with no prior programming
language.

## Where and when?
 - Where: AIfA CIP-Pool; Room 0.007 in the AIfA ground floor
 - When: 2:00 pm c.t. - 4 pm on each Monday (except public holidays) in the 2017 Summer Term

## Preconditions for the course
I assume familiarity with the *Linux* operating system, especially using the
*Unix*-command line.

## Computer / Laptop setup
Each student will work actively with an own computer in the AIfA CIP-Pool. All necessary software is already installed on the computers. For those, who would like to setup own computers/laptops with the proper software, I provide necessary information [here](https://github.com/terben/Introduction_to_Python_Bonn_Summer_2017/tree/master/computer_setup).
